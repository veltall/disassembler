Report for Homework 5

In general, everything works; there are no assembler errors or run-time errors.
I've had some time to test various scenarios for Problem 2, but not so much for problem 3.
However, I've run both programs through multiple inputs and both held up perfectly well.

There were a few assumptions that I had to make for Problem 2 (because the requirements were
not 100% clear). I forgot to document these at the time, but there should be short comments
in the code explicitly stating the assumptions.

Note: I expect my partner to also copy the code for the String->Hex converter routine from the 
disassembler project, so that part will be duplicated code between our submissions.
